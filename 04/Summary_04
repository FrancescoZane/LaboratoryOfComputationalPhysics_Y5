				NUMPY
Inizializzare e dimensioni
Reshaping and concatenation
Copies and views
Indexing (start:stop:step)
Slicing (identificare amtrice piu' piccola e lavorare su quella)
Fancy indexing (create copies)  nome_array[condizione]   oppure   nome_array[lista]   oppure   nome_array[matrice]
Basic operations (are element-wise operations) [add, sub, multiplications, ...]
Other operations [comparison (element-wise or array-wise), logical operations, apply functions to array, matricial operations]
Reductions: operations that reduce the dimensionality of arrays are called reductions. The reduction functions operate on the elements of an array and return a (set of) scalar(s)
Broadcasting: tâ€™s also possible to do operations on arrays of different sizes if NumPy can transform (broadcast) these arrays so that they all have the same size.

Probability Density Functions: numbers can be drawn from basically any common PDF (normal, binomial, chisquare, etc..)
